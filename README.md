## Kinemagics

Kinemagics is a one dimensional kinematics simulator. It allows the user
to pick from one of four preset movement patterns (reflective of a worksheet
used in my physics class) or draw their own, and then observe how
the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of an object with this
movement change over time.

Although it's based on a physics class, I did this mostly just for the
fun of it&mdash;to get a chance to work with Clojure and build a
useful study tool.
